StockBank is a networked piggybank that displays the current price of ONE share of top tech stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and counts down the current price of one share of the stock depending on the amount of coins inside the bank. As someone drops a coin in the bank, the display shows the amount of the stock share price decreasing until it levels off at zero which means that there is enough coinage inside the bank to buy one share of the stock in the display. When the bank is emptied, the counter resets back to another share price for a top tech stock and starts the process over until the amount matches the price. Once you hit the amount, the bank automatically buys the share of the stock for you.


The project exists as a networked object that prompts users to stay connected to the current stock valuation of technology corporations and see how they change and fluctuate over time. It reinvents the classic piggy bank by instead of counting money for saving, it connects in real-time to actual stock prices and gives the user an estimate on the amount of money they need to purchase a share of the specified stock.
